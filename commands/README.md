# DDL, DML, DCL

## DDL, DML, and DCL are three different types of commands used in databases:

1. DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to create, modify, and delete database objects like tables, views, and indexes. It's like building blocks that help you create the structure of your database.

+ `CREATE`: Used to create database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and procedures.
+ `ALTER`: Used to modify the structure of database objects.
+ `DROP`: Used to delete or remove database objects.
+ `TRUNCATE`: Used to remove all data from a table.
+ `RENAME`: Used to rename a database object.

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to add, modify, and delete data in the tables created using DDL. It's like adding or removing blocks to your building structure.

+ `SELECT`: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
+ `INSERT`: Used to insert new data into a table.
+ `UPDATE`: Used to modify existing data in a table.
+ `DELETE`: Used to remove data from a table.

3. DQL (Data Query Language) is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database, and perform operations such as filtering, sorting, and grouping. It is mainly used for data analysis and reporting purposes.

+ `SELECT`: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables, and to perform aggregate functions such as sum, count, and average

`So, to put it simply, DDL helps you create the structure of your database, DML helps you add, modify, and delete data in the database, and DCL helps you control who can access the database and what they can do with it.`
